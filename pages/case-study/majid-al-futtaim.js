            How we created a crisis content workflow during the onset of
            Covid-19
          </h2>
          <p>
            In January 2020, none of us knew what was coming. Not one of us knew
            the world was about to change forever. Not you, not me. Not clients,
            and not agencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the news about Covid-19 broke, Bloom Collective had recently
            started working alongside Majid Al Futtaim as their internal comms
            content agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the pandemic progressed and the world began to close its doors
            and borders, we knew we had to act fast to help Majid Al Futtaim
            communicate with their nearly 45,000 employees.
          </p>
          <p>This is how we did it.</p>

            At the onset of the pandemic the only certainty was uncertainty. The
            world had changed and it was palpable. Enitre nations were
            grappeling with how to cope. There was no precedent for how to run a
            multinational admidst a global virus outbreak, but as an
            organization, Majid Al Futtaim quickly sprung in to crisis
            leadership mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of February, governments across the Middle East and North
            Africa (MENA) began imposing shutdowns across public spaces
            including malls, cinemas, hotels and more. This resutled in the
            majority of MAF staff being forced to work from home – a practice
            that was uncommon in the Middle East at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Majid Al Futtaim's corporate communications creative content
            agency, Bloom Collective was in a unique position to co-create and
            co-ordinate the organization's group-wide internal response. We
            worked closely with their internal leadership team to do just that.

            As the organization began to implement measures in line with
            government mandated safety protocols, the workforce became almost
            entirely relient on internal digital channels for business updates,
            Covid news and need-to-know information. With a clear mandate that
            employee safety and wellness was the top priorty, our first step was
            to devise Covid-specific content categories to drive effective
            engagement around the crisis strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bloom Collective adjusted our team's work-from-home hours and
            introduced a 24/7 newsroom-style content workflow. Together with the
            client, this enabled us to ensure we stayed on top of the fast-pace
            of global information and quickly evolving local government
            recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also allowed us to address concerns being raised through the
            feedback mechanisms introduced as part of Majid Al Futtaim's wider
            internal communications crisis strategy. This gave us the
            flexibility to provide an always-on drumbeat of relevant and timely
            content for an increasingly anxious audience.

            In a period of just over four months we created over 150 custom
            animations, GIFs and social poster content for MAF's internal
            communications channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our content covered four main categories - covid safety content,
            covid news content, corporate updates and entertainment content.
            This allowed us to have a breadth of incoming information to produce
            on a daily basis. Content was also replicated and cascased through
            offline and external channels.
