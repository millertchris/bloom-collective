            How Bloom Collective designed a crisis content workflow during
            Covid-19
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>
              First and foremost, it should be said that while working through a
              pandemic is not something we would want to experience again – we
              are grateful to Majid Al Futtaim for the opportunity to help them
              communicate during this difficult time. They provided us with the
              resources we needed, the patience required, and the crucial timely
              feedback necessary to do this work. Without their cooperation, we
              couldn't have done it. So, hats off to amazing clients everywhere!
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>In January 2020,</b> the world was a different place as we had
            yet to hear about Covid-19. Coincidentally, during this time Bloom
            Collective was humbled to begin working alongside Majid Al Futtaim
            as their internal comms content agency. We were already knee-deep in
            planning and strategy for the upcoming year when news of Covid-19
            broke. As the world began to grind to a halt, we knew we had to
            pivot quickly to help MAF communicate with their nearly 45,000
            employees spread across 16 countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the middle of February and as the pandemic steadily
            progressed, governments across the Middle East and North Africa
            (MENA) began imposing shutdowns across public spaces including
            malls, cinemas, hotels and more. This resulted in the majority of
            Majid Al Futtaim's staff being forced to work from home – a practice
            that was uncommon in the Middle East at the time. While Covid made
            most everything uncertain, one thing was clear: communication would
            be crucial in maintaining any sense of normalcy across the
            organization.

            As Majid Al Futtaim's internal comms partner, Bloom Collective was
            in a unique position to co-create, coordinate and put in motion
            their groupwide internal response; We worked closely with their
            internal leadership through the chaos of the pandemic to do just
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there was no blueprint for how to run a multinational crisis
            response to a rapidly evolving global pandemic, we had to create one
            scratch. It was critical that MAF's internal comms were aligned in
            messaging while also being effective and agile in getting
            information to employees in real time. With a clear mandate from the
            beginning that employee safety and wellness was the top priority,
            our first step was to devise Covid-specific content categories to
            drive effective engagement around relevant messaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            To adapt to the rapidly evolving Covid news cycle, Bloom Collective
            adjusted our working schedule to align with that of our client and
            introduced a 24/7 around-the-clock response. This allowed us to
            rapidly address concerns being raised through the feedback
            mechanisms introduced as part of MAF's wider internal communications
            crisis strategy. This also gave us the flexibility to provide an
            always-on drumbeat of relevant and timely content for an
            increasingly anxious audience. We were able to produce content on
            demand as the situation progressed.

            Once our workflow was fully up and running, we effectively doubled
            the amount of content flowing through MAF's online channels. In a
            period of just over four months we created over 200 custom
            animations, GIFs, Newsers and social poster content for MAF's
            digital internal social networks. Much of this content was also
            replicated and cascaded through local offline and other external
            channels owned by MAF – such as inside of Carrefour grocery stores
            and other MAF properties across the Middle East.

            Thrice weekly check-in surveys measured overall sentiment throughout
            the pandemic. MAF scored +11 on global benchmarks set out to measure
            how staff perceived their clarity of communication and overall
            handling during Covid. This is, no doubt, due to the comms plan put
            together in cooperation between Majid Al Futtaim and Bloom
            Collective.
